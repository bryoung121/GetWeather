# GetWeather

Loved this test. I wrote a python application that would grab weather data at the beginning of the shift for the well operators
It would gather data and post it to a slack channel that we would set up at the begining of each well. This way the team members
would know if weather was on its way. Any lightning near a well is a bad deal so it helped the team know what to expect. 

I wrote this in VS 2019. I used topshelf to be able to debug and run the code.  Of course if you have any questions about this just let me know.
